# Surface-Crack-Detection-Analysis-using-Isolation-Forest-Algorithm
This Repository consists of two parts where the first part is dedicated to hold the isolation forest algorithm analysis on the dataset whereas the second part is dedicated to hold the K-folds technique implementation in conjunction to the isolation forest algorithm
## Project done using 
sklearn,numpy,pandas,zipfile and PIL in a google colab notebook
